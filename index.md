### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
Lab 1 has a special place in my heart because it marked my initiation into the coding world. It laid the foundation for my programming journey, teaching me the significance of syntax and how to greet the digital realm with a simple "Hello world" in C++. This initial exposure was pivotal, igniting my passion for coding and setting the stage for more complex challenges ahead.

* Lab 2
Lab 2 is a standout favorite as it delved into the fascinating world of arithmetic operations in C++. Through this lab, I not only grasped the core principles of mathematical computations in programming but also had the opportunity to collaborate with classmates. The connections I forged during this lab evolved into lasting friendships, enhancing my overall learning experience.

* Lab 3
Lab 3 holds a special allure due to its intricate and intellectually stimulating nature. This lab challenged me to calculate differences between user inputs, pushing my problem-solving skills to new heights. The satisfaction of crafting a complex solution was immensely rewarding, making Lab 3 a memorable and enlightening chapter of my coding journey.
